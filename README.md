# Data Normalization & Relational Modeling (Excel Power Query)

This repository documents the process of transforming a raw dataset into a well-structured relational database model through data normalization — from First Normal Form (1NF) to Third Normal Form (3NF) — using Microsoft Excel Power Query.

The goal of this project is to eliminate redundancy, ensure data integrity, and prepare the dataset for scalable relational database use (e.g., SQL Server, Access, or Power BI).

**Project Overview**

Raw data often contains redundant and inconsistent information that can cause reporting and analysis issues.
This project applies normalization principles to reorganize data into a relational schema that adheres to the first three normal forms.

**Objectives**

- Transform unstructured or denormalized data into well-defined relational tables

- Apply 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF using Excel Power Query

- Create a clean, connected relational model ready for database import or BI tools

- Demonstrate best practices for data modeling and relationship design
