# Data Normalization & Relational Modeling (Excel Power Query)

**Project Overview**

Raw data often contains redundant and inconsistent information that can cause reporting and analysis issues.
This project applies normalization principles to reorganize data into a relational schema that adheres to the first three normal forms.

**Objectives**

- Transform unstructured or denormalized data into well-defined relational tables

- Apply 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF using Excel Power Query

- Create a clean, connected relational model ready for database import or BI tools

- Demonstrate best practices for data modeling and relationship design
